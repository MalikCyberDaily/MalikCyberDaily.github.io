## Building a SOC + Honeynet in Azure (Live Traffic)
Constructed a Honeynet SOC in Microsoft Azure to capture and analyze security logs using Microsoft Sentinel and KQL. By comparing metrics before and after applying NIST SP 800-53 security controls, the project achieved a 99% reduction in Linux events and 100% elimination of malicious traffic and security incidents. This demonstrates the effectiveness of hardening tactics such as NSG rules, private endpoints, and built-in firewalls in securing cloud environments.

## Creating-Azure-Honeypot
This project involves deploying Windows and Linux VMs in Azure with NSGs configured to allow all inbound traffic, creating an open and vulnerable honeypot environment for security testing and monitoring.

## AWS Cloud Cybersecurity Homelab Red/Blue Team
In this project, a Red/Blue Team Cybersecurity Homelab was built in AWS using virtual machines (Windows, Kali Linux, Ubuntu) connected via a VPC. Splunk was configured on the Ubuntu machine to collect and analyze Windows Event Logs, while Tenable Nessus enabled vulnerability scanning, allowing for realistic threat simulations and monitoring within a controlled cloud environment.

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
